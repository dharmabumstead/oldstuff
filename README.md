# oldstuff
Nothing useful here - just very old stuff. Specifically: Chrysler factory floor automation from 1991. This ran the "LH" auto factory in Bramalea, Ontario.

Please note that I had just learned C at the time (they originally wanted me to do it in Easel! Google it) and this code has plenty of hacky ugly bad things that make me cringe a bit now. But it worked.
